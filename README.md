# ASE_GROUP_3


We are really good at getting location data

Key_info:

For each deliverable (except Task 1), please submit a Git tag in the group's Git repo and email it to the customer; a team member then has to arrange a meeting with the customer (these can be done after the respective deadlines, but not too much after). Important: please alert the customer of the software engineering techniques / tools that your team chooses and please demonstrate it, otherwise the customer might not be aware of their use. For example, if you have been using a CI tool, please run the customer through an example CI session. Additional notes and comments can be found here.

Task 2. Produce a simple Android and/or iPhone or cross-platform app. Deadline: Friday, 22 October 2021, at 16:00.
Description: Produce an Android or iPhone or cross-platform app that displays the phone's current GPS position on the phone. The point of this task is for you to familiarise yourself with the Android/iOS or cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter, and their development tools and APIs. There will be no lectures about the Android and/or iOS system. It's your responsibility to learn about it (don't worry, it's easy). Note that I've left many things vague in this specification, like what format to use for display, how often should it be updated? What should happen if GPS isn't switched on, or GPS data not available? The options include printing out GPS coordinates, displaying the position on Google Maps, or on Open Streetmap, or anything else.
Given the abilities of Google's Android and/or iOS SDK, this is a fairly easy task. If you have done Android and/or iOS development before, maybe leave this task you team members that have not done Android and/or iPhone before, and mentor them. That's good leadership and good software engineering practise.



# Assignment Description

The group project is intended to simulate real-world software development. You are asked to address the technical and social difficulties presented by multi-person, multi-version software projects. This includes planning, scheduling, researching, specifying, designing, building, testing and documenting high-quality software. You will have to demonstrate a controlled approach to quality control, configuration management and build/test automation. A further important part of your project is to communicate effectively within your team and with the customer (module convenor). This includes dealing with problems that are likely to arise when teams work together for extended periods of time. You are free to choose whatever software engineering methodology, tools and development styles you want, but the project is structured to favour agile development with an emphasis on proper testing.

The class will be divided into several software houses (you can find group allocations on the module's Canvas page). Each will negotiate with the customer the staged development and delivery of a software product. The software house will be disbanded at the end of the course, so it is important that the product is well-specified, has high-quality documentation, and can be easily maintained.

As the project is intended to be developed using agile methods, the required software deliverables are revealed step-by-step. Some of the later deliverables may require previously built software to be modified. Here's an outline of how the customer will present the project to groups:

    Customer proposes a new feature.
    Each group plans, designs, implements, and tests new feature.
    Group (or group representative) presents the result to the customer, including (where appropriate) demonstration of tool usage and build automation.
    Repeat until the module finishes.

Project outline

The project is about building a mobile app that runs on Android and/or iOS. Note that you do not need an Android and/or iPhone device (phone or pad) to do your group project. The Android and/or iPhone SDKs come with powerful emulators that are sufficient for development; commercial apps have been written entirely using these emulators.
Deliverables

Here is the currently partial list of software deliverables. The remaining parts will be revealed in stages (to spare you from planning ahead in terms of features).

    Task 1. Each group should set up a GitHub account to be used for the project. See here for details.
    Task 2. Produce a simple Android and/or iPhone or cross-platform app. See here for details.
        Deadline: Friday, 22 October 2021, at 16:00.
    Task 3. TBA.
    Task 4. TBA.
    Task 5. TBA.

For each deliverable (except Task 1), please submit a Git tag in the group's Git repo and email it to the customer; a team member then has to arrange a meeting with the customer (these can be done after the respective deadlines, but not too much after). Important: please alert the customer of the software engineering techniques / tools that your team chooses and please demonstrate it, otherwise the customer might not be aware of their use. For example, if you have been using a CI tool, please run the customer through an example CI session. Additional notes and comments can be found here.
Additional deliverables

In addition to the software deliverables above, groups also have the following additional deliverables with deadlines.

    The project plan.
        Deadline: Tuesday, 19 October 2021, at 16:00.
    The peer assessment. See here for a description of how the individual marks are computed from group marks.
        Deadline: Friday, 10 December 2021, at 16:00.
    A short reflective essay on feature of the group's software engineering process.
        Deadline: Friday, 10 December 2021, at 16:00.

Please email each of these directly to the customer by their deadlines (no demonstration needed).
Weightings of deliverables

Find the relative weights of the individual deliverables for the overall group mark below.

    Deliverable 1: 0%
    Deliverable 2: 5%
    Deliverable 3: 10%
    Deliverable 4: 40%,
    Deliverable 5: 25%,
    Project plan: 5%
    Reflective essay: 15%

Please note that failing to produce a peer assessment will result in a deduction of 25 marks!
Late submission policy

These deadlines are firm and will not be extended for any reason.
Assessment

The group project will be assessed by the module convenor on:

    The scope of the project (i.e. of two otherwise equal projects, the more difficult one will get better grades).
    The quality of the deliverables, including absence of bugs, and modularity/extensibility of the architecture, design and implementation.
    How clear the schedule for each milestone is (where applicable), and how well it is met (for example, if it takes you a long time to finish a small deliverable, you will not get a very good mark).
    How well the delivered software meets its specification (a small project that delivers on all its promises will get a better grade than a large project that doesn't).
    Quality of the testing process, e.g. degree of coverage, degree of test automation, quality of peer reviews.
    How well the project team functioned as a working unit.
    How well the team presents its architecture, design and testing process.

Since the project is split into several small deliverables, the overall group mark will be determined from cumulative assessment of the deliverables. Individual marks for group members will be determined by peer assessment.
