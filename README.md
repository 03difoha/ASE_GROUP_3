# ASE_GROUP_3


We are really good at getting location data

Key_info:

For each deliverable (except Task 1), please submit a Git tag in the group's Git repo and email it to the customer; a team member then has to arrange a meeting with the customer (these can be done after the respective deadlines, but not too much after). Important: please alert the customer of the software engineering techniques / tools that your team chooses and please demonstrate it, otherwise the customer might not be aware of their use. For example, if you have been using a CI tool, please run the customer through an example CI session. Additional notes and comments can be found here.

Task 2. Produce a simple Android and/or iPhone or cross-platform app. Deadline: Friday, 22 October 2021, at 16:00.
Description: Produce an Android or iPhone or cross-platform app that displays the phone's current GPS position on the phone. The point of this task is for you to familiarise yourself with the Android/iOS or cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter, and their development tools and APIs. There will be no lectures about the Android and/or iOS system. It's your responsibility to learn about it (don't worry, it's easy). Note that I've left many things vague in this specification, like what format to use for display, how often should it be updated? What should happen if GPS isn't switched on, or GPS data not available? The options include printing out GPS coordinates, displaying the position on Google Maps, or on Open Streetmap, or anything else.
Given the abilities of Google's Android and/or iOS SDK, this is a fairly easy task. If you have done Android and/or iOS development before, maybe leave this task you team members that have not done Android and/or iPhone before, and mentor them. That's good leadership and good software engineering practise.
